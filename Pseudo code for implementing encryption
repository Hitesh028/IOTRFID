Pseudo code for implementing encryption:

Add ca-certificate that was created on the raspberry pi (server) to an array in program memory.
ca_cert[] PROGMEM <= R"EOF(
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ADD CERTIFICATE 
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
)EOF";

Use WiFiClientSecure instead WiFiClient
Make client/object of WiFiClientSecure 
void verify_Fingerprint():
 If client object connected:
     Return
Print => TLS connection verifying
Print => ………

The BearSSL library is used to perform all cryptography and TLS operations. 

BearSSL::X509List cert(ca_cert)
X509 is a public key distribution method.
setTrustAnchors issue trust among communicating nodes
setTrustAnchors(&cert)
If client is not connected:
    Print => reconnecting client 
Set bool success <= False
Success <= Store connection result
If success:
    Print => Successfully verified with servers !!! ->
Else:
    Print => Connection insecure 
     ESP.restart()
Client stop
